        Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Priya Kumari</span>,
        a passionate web developer and 2nd-year engineering student at ABES Engineering College.
        I love building clean, user-friendly web experiences and experimenting with new
        technologies like React, Next.js, and Python.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring hackathons, working on open-source projects,
        and learning about AI and real-time systems. I believe in writing clean,
        scalable code and turning creative ideas into impactful products.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My current focus: sharpening my full-stack skills and contributing to meaningful projects.
